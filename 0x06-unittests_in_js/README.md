# 0x06. Unittests in JS

This guide provides an overview of the concepts and resources related to unit testing in JavaScript using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon. The project focuses on writing effective unit tests for your Node.js applications.

## Resources

Read or watch the following resources to better understand unit testing:

- [Mocha Documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Gx5mfX41__cc2hwepcl0aA)
- [Chai Documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Rs3SrSdr9OxPp-4099A0cg)
- [Sinon Documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/5KsW5N9sG3sGWW3z-jkNwA)
- [Express Documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/Jq58SNUh8jcZqKoFcuOQdw)
- [Request Documentation](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/FcJfzr2jUJSj8Xp3z9L1wg)
- [How to Test NodeJS Apps using Mocha, Chai, and SinonJS](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/HwB8gViDosy8znk7H9i4Pw)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following concepts without using external references:

1. How to use Mocha to write a test suite
2. How to use different assertion libraries (Node's built-in assertions or Chai)
3. Strategies for presenting long test suites effectively
4. When and how to use spies
5. When and how to use stubs
6. Understanding the purpose of hooks and when to use them
7. Unit testing with asynchronous functions
8. Writing integration tests using a small Node.js server

## Requirements

- All of your code will be executed on Ubuntu 18.04 using Node 12.x.x
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs, Visual Studio Code
- All your files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file at the root of the project folder is mandatory
- Your code should use the `.js` extension
- When running every test with `npm run test *.test.js`, all tests should pass without warnings or errors
